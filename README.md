### Update to the update
I (seemingly) found a fix for the update to 9.1.

### UPDATE 
Prism Launcher 9.0 and later has patched this, hence this guide is effectivly useless now, this **only** works on Prism Launcher versions below 9.0. For 9.0, I recommend just using a cracked fork of Prism like [this one](https://github.com/Diegiwg/PrismLauncher-Cracked/releases), which I heard is safe, but I'd recommend downloading directly through GitHub actions.

# Add Offline Accounts to PrismLauncher Guide (updated for 9.1)
The steps on how to add cracked accounts on PrismLauncher w/o Microsoft login

1) Install the official PrismLauncher from https://prismlauncher.org/download/windows/
* I recommend the portable version, so it keeps all its files in the same place.
2) Click on the accounts.json file, and in the top right corner click the download button to download the file.
3) Move it to the Root directory: Press Win+R and write "%appdata%\PrismLauncher"
4) Open PrismLauncher and add an offline account, then set it as default.
* DO NOT delete the original account (named XYZ).
